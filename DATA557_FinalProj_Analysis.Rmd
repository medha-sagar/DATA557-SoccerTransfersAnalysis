Question 1

Question 1: How does a traded player's overall rating affect the success of the team that they were traded to (measured in point differential between the season before and the season after arrival)?
Outcome: difference in points in this season from the previous season
Primary predictor: the overall rating of the player before he was traded.
Potential confounders: player's position, team, season, league, number of minutes played

```{r Question 1}
summary(lm(points_diff ~ overall_rating+factor(position)+factor(to)+factor(season)+as.numeric(minutes_played)+rank_before,data = data))
```

Question 2:  Whether the position affect the association between success score and rating
Outcome: difference in success score in this season from the previous season
Primary predictor: the overall rating of the player before he was traded
Interaction term: position (4 positions) and rating
Potential confounders: Parameters that will be included in the model- player's position, season, league, number of minutes played

```{r Question 2}
summary(lm(points_diff ~ position:overall_rating+overall_rating+factor(position)+factor(to)+factor(season)+as.numeric(minutes_played)+rank_before, data=data))
```

Question 3: Does the rating affect the association between transfer money and the impact of each player. We will use a linear regression model. The outcome for this model is the effect of each player using the beta coefficient of the rating of the first model. 
Outcome: Transfer money
Primary predictor: player's impact- the difference in points in this season from the previous season times the coefficient of the rating variable in the first model
Interaction term: player's impact and rating
Potential confounders: player's position, season, league, number of minutes played

```{r Question 3}
data <- data[!is.na(data$price_num), ]
summary(lm(price_num ~ points_diff:overall_rating+points_diff+overall_rating+factor(position)+factor(to)+factor(season)+as.numeric(minutes_played)+rank_before, data=data))
```
